# üåßÔ∏è Rain Garden Planner and Impact Simulator

## Description
This interactive web application helps users plan rain gardens by simulating storm events and providing insights based on GIS data. It integrates elevation data, weather forecasts, and environmental datasets to assess the impact of rain gardens in mitigating runoff.

---

## **Features**
- **MS4 Service Areas Visualization:** Explore municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) boundaries on an interactive map.
- **Elevation Data Analysis:** View and analyze elevation data to plan effective garden placement.
- **Storm Event Simulation:** Visualize past storm events in a specific location and assess their impact.
- **Weather Integration:** Get real-time weather data through OpenWeatherMap API to assist in planning.
- **Heat Map:** Display storm event density through an interactive heatmap.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Backend logic and data processing.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building the interactive interface.
- **Folium**: Interactive mapping tool for GIS data visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Fetch real-time weather information.
